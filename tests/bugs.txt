ID:	date	tested program version		description of a bug
jk001: 20120809 open Remove bridge costs more than build it. Detected in master too.	tc0002,step 7, pak128.cz
	Solution: discussed in forum, it is feature.
jk002: 20120809 open Remove tunnel costs more than build it. Detected in master too.	tc0002,step 11, pak128.cz
	Solution: discussed in forum, it is feature.
jk003: 20120809 open Maintenance not subtracted correctly when tunnel was build and than deleted. Maintenance is accounted to TT_OTHER! 	tc0002,step 11, pak128.cz
	FIXED in r5924-rc3
jk004: 20120916 r5924-rc2 Deletion of tunnel causes crash. Caused by NULL pointer in tunnel_besch_t::get_finance_waytype().	tc0002, step 12, pak128.cz, 
	FIXED in r5924-rc3
jk005: 20120916 r5924-rc3 Tunnel mount connected to road cost less to destroy than unconnected. --> try it with current trunk (master) branch to see if it is a bug or feature.
	NOT A BUG Binary compilled from current trunk code (r5927) has the same behavior.
jk006: 20120916 r5923-rc3 Maintenance in not being subracted from current account when new month comes.		tc???, pak128.cz
	FIXED
jk007: 20120916 r5924-rc3 Construction costs of road depot are being accounted to TT_OTHER instead of TT_ROAD		tc0002, step17, pak128.cz
	FIXED - ding/gebauede.cc:902 (book_construction_costs params) 
jk008: 20120916 r5924-rc3 Removal costs of road gate and choose point are being accounted to TT_ALL.		tc0002, step 22 and 24, pak128.cz
	FIXED
jk009: 20120916 r5927-rc1 (and current master) "Profit" of vehicle or line does NOT take into account way toll. Line showing gain might be in reality in red numbers.
	OPEN - merged from master (not caused by my new money stats code)
	--> needs to be reported
jk010: 20120916 r5927-rc1 Charts in vehicle stats and in line stats shows rounded values of proceeds, operation costs and profit.
	OPEN - merged from master
	--> needs to be reported
jk011: 20120922 r5935-rc1 Construction cost of railway station building accounted to TT_OTHER, maintenance accounted correctly. Removal costs accounted correctly. (tc0004, 25) 
	Bug is in simwerk.cc in function wkz_station_building_aux
	FIXED (r5935-rc2)
jk012: 20120928 r5935-rc2 Game crashes when shipyard is being placed.
	FIXED
jk013: 20120928 r5954-rc2, r5954 (master) Game stops (does not crash) during creationg new game with pak128.cz in (or after) phase "Creating cities". Probably deadlock. Map 3445, size 320 x 256

	Dear simutrans development team, I would like to report that a deadlock present in game.
	I have been testing new simutrans functionality, when the game stuck. I have recompiled game using code of current master branch ( = trunk, revision 5954) and saw the same behavior. 
	So I ran simutrans in gdb. When the game had stuck, I printed back trace.

	How to reproduce it:
	1) Start simutrans with pak128.cz. I have tested it with pak64, pak64.german, pak128 and pak128.Britain but I have no clue why it happens only with pak128.cz and other pak sets are not affected.
	2) click on "new game" button.
	3) set map number to "3445"
	4) set size to 320 x 256.
	5) Click on start game.
	6) Program print "Creating cities" in command line and than stops on deadlock.
