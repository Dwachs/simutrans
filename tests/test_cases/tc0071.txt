description=""

Prerequisities:
tc0001 succesfully completed

Test scenario:
1. Open narrow gauge tools
: Narrow gauge tools menu was opened.

2. Build a track on clean tile(s).
: Money is accounted as construction cost of narrow gauge.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of all types.
: Money is subtracted from cash flow.
: Money is subtracted from account (konto).
: Maitenance of narrow gauge is correctly increased.
: Maitenance of all is correctly increased.
: Money message was displayed.

3. Build a track on tile with obstacle (tree, groundobj)
: Money for track construction is accounted as construction cost of narrow gauge.
: Money for tree removal is accounted as construction cost of "narrow gauge".
: Money (track construction plus tree removal) is accounted as construction cost of all types.
: Money is subtracted from cash flow.
: Money is subtracted from account (konto).
: Maitenance is correctly increased.
: Money message was displayed.

4. Remove narrow gauge using "remove narrow gauge" tool
: Money is accounted as construction cost of narrow gauge.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of all types.
: Money is subtracted from cash flow.
: Money is subtracted from account (konto).
: Maitenance is correctly decreased.
: Money message was displayed.

5. Remove narrow gauge using "dynamite tool/buldozer tool"
: (Result should be same as in step 4.)
: Money is accounted as construction cost of narrow gauge.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of all types.
: Money is subtracted from cash flow.
: Money is subtracted from account (konto).
: Maitenance is correctly decreased.
: Money message was displayed.

6. Upgrade narrow gauge.
  pak64.german does not have this option, pak128.cz has it.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of narrow gauge.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of all types.
: Money is subtracted from cash flow.
: Money is subtracted from account (konto).
: Maitenance is correctly increased/decreased. (Maintenance has to be increased/decreased only by difference between previous state and current state values.)
: Money message was displayed.

7. Build narrow gauge electrification.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of narrow gauge.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of all types.
: Money is subtracted from cash flow.
: Money is subtracted from account (konto).
: Maitenance is correctly increased. 
: Money message was displayed.

8. Remove the electrification.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of narrow gauge.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of all types.
: Money is subtracted from cash flow.
: Money is subtracted from account (konto).
: Maitenance is correctly decreased.
: Money message was displayed.

9. Make narrow gauge track public.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of narrow gauge.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of narrow gauge of public player.
: Money is accounted as construction cost of all types.
: Money is subtracted from cash flow.
: Money is subtracted from account (konto).
: Maitenance is correctly decreased.
: Maitenance of public player for narrow gauge is correctly increased.
: Money message was displayed.
